                            In the face of many games using lootboxes for<br>
                             monetization, there are a few games that are<br>
                             successful with different, less predatory ways of making money. For example, Monster Hunter World offers a direct purchase system,
                             where instead of buying a chance at the item you want, you just buy it directly. Aditionally, all the items for sale are only cosmetic,
                             reducing the incentive for many people to actually spend their money on the game. Finally, and most importantly, Monster Hunter World 
                             sells itself as a full, self contained experience. If the option to buy these were removed, the game would lose almost nothing, and the game
                             doesn't constantly shove things you can purchase in your face. It lets the gameplay speak for itself.

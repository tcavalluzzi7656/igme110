                    <p style="position: relative; left: 10px; top:-20px; font-size: 20px">"Lootbox" is a term commonly applied to <br>
                    systems in games that let users buy a package of<br>
                    items without knowing the contents of it prior.<br>
                    The lootboxes commonly contain items for use <br>
                    in game, such as special items that can enhance ones power in game, cosmetics that can<br>
                    change how a person looks, among other things. Due to their random nature and direct monetary
                    value, lootboxes have recently come under fire for their similarity to real world gambling.
                    This website serves to demonstrate some of the reasons how lootboxes can be harmful, and some
                    of the ways that games could replace them with different, more ethical<br>   forms of monetization.
